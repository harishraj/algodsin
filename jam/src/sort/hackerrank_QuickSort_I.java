/*QuickSort_I

 Given an array ar and a number p, can you partition the array, so that all
 elements greater than p are to the right of it and all the numbers smaller
 than p are to its left?

 Besides for necessary partitioning, the numbers should otherwise remain in the
 same order. This means if n1 was before n2 in the original array, it must
 remain before it in the partitioned array, unless n1 > p > n2.

 Constraints
 1<=n<=1000 
 -1000<=x<= 1000 , x âˆˆ ar

 Sample Input
 5
 4 5 3 7 2

 Sample Output
 3 2 4 5 7

 Explanation
 p = 4. The 5 was moved to the right of the 4, and the 2 was moved to the left of
 4. The numbers otherwise remained in the same order.
